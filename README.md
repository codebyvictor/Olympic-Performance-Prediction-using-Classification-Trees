# Olympic Performance Prediction using Classification Trees
This project follows the story of a sport recruiter that makes use of data analytics to identify young athletes with high potential. The data regrouped more than 270,000 performances that occured in the Olympics up to 2016. This analysis highlights the importance of data analytics in fields such as sport management but also helps athletes be more aware of their strengths and weaknesses. 

Statistical techniques such as decision trees, multiple regression, annd random forests were used to find a model to make the most accurate predictions in future performances. 

The code was made using R language, graphs were made with the library GGplot, and the report was wrote on Latex. 

The accuracy of the model was tested using a variety of metrics, and found that it was able to make accurate predictions with a high degree of precision. As the dataset keeps growing with new Olympics data being added, the algorithm is going to constantly learn and identify new trends and adjust the predictions accordingly.
